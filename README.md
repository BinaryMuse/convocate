Convocate
=========

Convocate is an open source, real time chat application that runs in the browser. It works great with [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/).

Currently, it is *very* early in Convocate's development lifecycle, and this repository is under heavy churn (and much of the code you see here is testing and MVP work).

Convocate's feature set will be lighter earlier on to focus on getting a working product out as soon as possible. However, here are some of the things you can look forward to with Convocate, either in the short or long term.

  * Open source--host a chat server on your own public server or inside your own corporate firewall
  * Easy-to-use chat, in the browser or with tools like [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/)
  * Statuses (available, idle, away) with custom status messages for online users
  * Growl notifications when someone mentions your name (or some other text, customizable in the settings)
  * Rich inline previews for links to images, Tweets, GitHub Gists, etc.
  * Unread message counts on the in-app chat tabs and on the browser favicon--ideal for a "pinned" tab in Chrome
  * Drag-and-drop file uploads, with inline previews for certain file types, as well as a list of recently uploaded files
  * Searchable transcripts, including uploaded files
  * One-on-one chats and private chat rooms that require a password or invitation
  * A REST and streaming API suitable for building integration apps and third-party clients
